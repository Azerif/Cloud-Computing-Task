# Cloud Computing Task

## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at deploying threads using web hosting, showcasing a multithreading simulation in a cloud environment. The project utilizes JavaScript and Node.js along with Docker for efficient containerization and deployment, providing a robust solution for simulating concurrent tasks.

## Features
- **Multithreading Simulation**: Implements a simulation of worker threads to manage multiple cooking orders concurrently.
- **Docker Integration**: Utilizes Docker for containerization, making it easier to deploy and manage the application.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly frontend interface created with HTML to interact with the backend services seamlessly.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports scalability, allowing for easy addition of new features and services.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic and handling asynchronous tasks.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the core functionality and simulation logic.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and simplifying the deployment process.
- **HTML/CSS**: For developing the frontend user interface.
